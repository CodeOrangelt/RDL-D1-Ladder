                            Scoring System: To prove your skill, players compete for the position on the ladder and not ELO; however, your ELO will determine your skill level. The skill levels are Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Emerald. To achieve Emerald, you will have to face a gauntlet of the top emerald pilots, achieve a score of 17 or more AND have the ELO to back it up. Promotions will be based on your ELO. ELO will not be shown as that is not your primary concern for competitive Descent. The ladder placement and skill level are your main driving force.

                            Players must agree on a level before proceeding. If players cannot agree on a level, players will choose from each pilot’s home at least once. Players may opt to play a third if they choose.

                            Players cannot camp on ladder spots. Pilots can challenge any pilot to take his spot. When you challenge someone, each pilot must play at least one of each opponent’s homes.
                            Players must accept a challenge within a two-week period or risk a reduction in ladder placement.  
                            Only the top three ranked players can challenge each other.
                            You can only issue a challenge once a week per pilot. Top 30 percent of pilots are only allowed to issue challenges to one another.  The Challenged person can reject the challenge but will be moved to the bottom of the ladder.

                            Extended times are accepted as long as both players agree on the duration of the time limit. The player must justify the extended timeout. If justification is not heard the map will forfeit  
                            Extended time outs are 10 minutes or longer.

                            You can choose any map you wish if it follows the Home Level Framework
                            Homes are used to prevent the DCL core map mechanic, prevent map anglers, and allow those that disagree on maps play a game. Maps should follow this standard. Home maps that do not follow this standard will be rejected.  Homes should be used as a last-ditch measure for pilots to play. Ideally pilots should agree on maps and not angle on one level. Map diversity is encouraged on the RDL.The Home Level Framework is as follows: <br>
                            1.  Primary weapons should be equal number. <br>
                            2.	Weapons should not focus on subtype matches i.e. (disorientation, single use weapons, rat, blind)  <br>
                            3.	Map sizes should be reasonably sized for 1v1 play.  <br>
                            4.	Maps that missile boat is prohibited.  (i.e. Levels where you are maxed out on missiles, and there are a ton more missiles to pick up)<br>
                            5.	Home Maps should be stock i.e. (No MCAPs, or Xs).  <br>

                                With heavy consideration of previous attempts to determine the "core maps" that should
                                be played when maps cannot be agreed on, the RDL is committed to finding a way to ensure
                                players can always play a fair match, but also prohibit players from reliably choosing
                                maps they know they will excell in. Map core will consist of a variety of maps, and will
                                be conditioned to exclude overtly-repetitve map-types regardless of statistical
                                domination. More on "Map Core" after beta release.
