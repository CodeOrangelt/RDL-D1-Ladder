Homes are used to prevent the DCL core map mechanic, prevent map anglers, and allow those that disagree on maps play a game. Maps should follow this standard. Home maps that do not follow this standard will be rejected. Homes should be used as a last-ditch measure for pilots to play. Ideally pilots should agree on maps and not angle on one level. Map diversity is encouraged on the RDL. Do keep in mind, these restrictions are reserved for when you and your opponent want to play a match, but cannot decide on what map to play.</p>
