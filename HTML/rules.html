                            <ul>
                                <li>Before joining, all Pilots must provide a valid email address. The RDL will verify
                                    its authenticity as part of the registration process</li>
                                <p>

                                    <li>Pilots must not use aliases. We would like pilots to go by their common pilot.
                                        For example, b2af should not register as b2.
                                        Maintain a consistent name throughout the Descent community.</li>
                                <p>
                                    <li>Country: Setting your home country is recommended but optional. The RDL would
                                        like for you to set your country so others can prepare for a high-ping match.
                                    </li>
                                <p <li>Players must register with three home maps that follow the home level framework.
                                    </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Home Level Frame Work</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Homes should be used as a last-ditch measure for pilots to play. Ideally, you
                                    should
                                    agree on maps rather than rely on one single level. Map diversity is encouraged on
                                    the
                                    RDL.</li>
                                </p>
                                <li>Home maps that do not follow this standard will be rejected.

                            </ul>
                            The Home Level Framework standard is as follows:</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Primary weapons should be equal in number.</li>
                                <li>Weapons should not focus on subtype matches (e.g., disorientation, single-use
                                    weapons, rat, Gauss and Mercs, etc.).</li>
                                <li>Map sizes should be reasonably sized for 1v1 play.</li>
                                <li>Maps that encourage "missile boating" are prohibited. (e.g., levels that start
                                    players with maxed-out missiles and include large caches of additional
                                    missiles).</li>
                                <li>Home Maps should be stock (e.g., no MCAPs or Xs).</li>
                            </ol>



                            <h5>Version Requirements</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For Descent/Descent II, players must use only the game files provided by Steam,
                                    GOG, or the US CD versions of the game, and the most recent DXX-Redux build (<a
                                        href="https://dxx-redux.com/" target="_blank">Click here</a>), currently
                                    v1.1.</li>
                                <p></p>
                                <li>For Descent 3, players must use the Piccu Engine along with game files provided
                                    by Steam, GOG, or the CD versions of the game. The current Piccu Engine is
                                    v1.2.2 and can be found <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/PiccuEngine"

                                <p></p>
                                <li>Any D1/D2/D3 experimental builds are prohibited in RDL ladder matches.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h4>RDL Rankings</h4>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ranking System: The RDL uses a ladder system to rank players. Players are ranked
                                    based on their Elo rating, which is calculated based on match performance.</li>
                                <p></p>
                                <li>Scoring System: To prove your skill, players compete for ladder positions. However,
                                    ELO determines your skill level. Skill levels are Bronze, Silver, Gold, and
                                    Emerald.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>The Ladder System</h5>
                            <p>The ranges are as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>1400–1600: Bronze</li>
                                <li>1600–1800: Silver</li>
                                <li>1800–2000: Gold</li>
                                <li>2000+: Emerald</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Players gain or lose Elo based on match performance and are placed according to
                                    their
                                    latest ELO value. ELO is not determined by K/D ratio, but by wins against opponents
                                    (upsets grant bigger gains). The ladder resets with all pilots at 0 matches each
                                    season.
                                    However, ELO does not reset.

                                    the match resumes.</li>

                                    forfeited.</li>

                            <p>The RDL uses the standard ELO rating system with a K-factor of 32:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Expected Score:</strong> Based on the ELO difference between players</li>
                                <li><strong>Actual Score:</strong> 1 for win, 0 for loss</li>
                                <li><strong>ELO Change:</strong> K-factor × (Actual Score - Expected Score)</li>
                                <li><strong>Upsets:</strong> Lower-rated players gain more ELO when beating higher-rated opponents</li>
                                <li><strong>Favored Wins:</strong> Higher-rated players gain less ELO when beating lower-rated opponents</li>
