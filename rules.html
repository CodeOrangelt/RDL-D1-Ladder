                            Repect other pilots, no matter your history, no matter your arguments, no matter your opinions, respect your opponent. Obviously you're allowed to dislike certain individuals, but disrespect does not have a place on this ladder. Getting headed is normal, and expected in this community, but once the barrier is crossed where what you are doing is no longer competitively respectable, you could expect demotions, or a ban from the any one if not all ladders on the RDL.

                        <p class="rules-text">
                            Part of being on a ladder is competing for your rank, dominance, and position. Intentionally or neglectfully avoiding matches can result in warnings, or ultimately demotions. Camping is a massive deterance to dynamic and refreshing play. (Camping defined as: Ingoring matches while #1 for a pro-longed amount of time)

                            You are not allowed to have multiple accounts on one ladder. You are also not allowed to have Aliases designed to deceive or guise as other players with a malicious or deceptive intent. (Fun aliases are most definetly allowed as long as you define your commonly-known alias in the box found on your profile.)

                            If rule #1 didn't make it clear enough, you're arguments, and disputes are to be kept private. If you have a dispute with another player, please contact an admin, or a moderator to help resolve the issue. Please exercise all methods of working towards either letting it go or resolving the argument before getting the ladder admins involved.

                            To win a game, you must end the game by two kills, as in, 21 to 19 for instance. If you leave rage quit a match, you LOSE. Recording games will be reccomended in the instance, with review of the situation by an admin, an automatic win could be awarded. Additionally, the latest version of Redux must be played. Experimental builds are not prohibited.

                        <p class="rules-text">
                            With heavy consideration of previous attempts to determine the "core maps" that should be played when maps cannot be agreed on, the RDL is committed to finding a way to ensure players can always play a fair match, but also prohibit players abstaining from choosing maps they know they will excell in. Map core will consist of a variety of maps, and will be conditioned to exclude overtly-repetitve map-types regardless of statistical domination. More on "Map Core" after beta release.
